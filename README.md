# BioTopia: Urban Bio Space Simulator

**Developer:** Lennart Weissenstein (Team Project)  
**Role:** Environment 3D Artist, Tech Artist, Game Designer  
**Platform:** Mobile / Tablet (Unity)

### Overview

BioTopia is a serious game developed in collaboration with the **Food4Future (f4f)** and the **Leibniz-Institut für Gemüse- und Zierpflanzenbau (IGZ)** initiatives.
The game acts as a simulation of a future where agricultural land is scarce, trade is halted, and freshwater is dwindling. It challenges players to utilize alternative methods of food production—such as crickets, jellyfish, macroalgae, and halophytes—within tight urban spaces to feed a growing population.
Originally conceptualized for PC, the project was ported to mobile and tablet devices to maximize accessibility for public demonstrations and industry events.

### My Contributions

My primary focus during development was ensuring a clear visual identity and managing the gap between art assets and technical implementation in Unity.

* **3D Environment Art & Modeling:** Modeled and textured key environment assets.
* **Technical Art & Pipeline:** Responsible for the asset pipeline; I took models created by various team members and optimized them to ensure a clean, congruent state and consistent art style across the game.
* **Material Setup:** Created and managed materials and shaders within Unity to achieve the desired visual aesthetic while maintaining performance on mobile devices.
* **Game Design:** Collaborated on core gameplay mechanics, overall game look & feel and implementation of research results.

### Gameplay & Features

BioTopia is a city-building management game where the player does not control the city layout itself, but rather how to utilize the limited space provided for an ever growing city.

* **Urban Biospaces:** Players place specialized compartments in building to produce food.
* **Procedural Growth:** The city growth simulates the decreasing available space in urban areas.
* **Resource Management:** Building a system of compartments and investing in research to maintain the nutrient needs of the growing population.
* **Real-world Research:** The game is created to display the research work of the organizations food4future and IGZ. Some gameplay elements are based on real research for sustainable urban food production provided by them.

### Development & Team

We worked in an agile team environment with a strong focus on communication and version control standards. Our workflow included weekly meetings, issue tracking via GitLab, and peer code reviews to ensure stability.

**The Team:**
* Alejandro Martinez Hernandez
* Alexander Jäger
* Anton Lehmann
* Harvey Benn
* Konstantin Schiwarov
* Tobias Bayer
* Lennart Weissenstein

### Challenges & Learnings

* **Mobile Optimization:** Moving from a PC prototype to a mobile build required significant optimization of materials and poly-counts to ensure smooth performance without sacrificing the visual style.
* **Clean Assets:** Combining assets from multiple artists required communication and establishing clear technical specifications to ensure the game looked like a cohesive product.
* **Implementing Scientific Research:** The main design challenge was translating more complex data of nutrient values and growth cycles of organisms into intuitive gameplay - which is fun to play but scientifically grounded.
